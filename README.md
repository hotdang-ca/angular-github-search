# Github Search

## About
Just a little project to search github users. Testing out [Angular 2](https://angular.io).

## Files
Generated using the now outdated [Angular 2 Quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart). Why? Because I'm following an older tutorial whose own sample files don't actually compile. To protect the innocent, I won't mention whose tutorial that is. But, the offical Angular 2 Quickstart guide seems to work just dandy :)

Added the functionality in `src/app/**/*`.

## Getting Started
Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

## License
Currently UNLICENSED for any use.
